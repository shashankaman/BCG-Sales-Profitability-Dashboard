* Sales transaction data
* Revenue and cost information
* Product and regional dimensions

### 🧹 Data Preparation (HOW)

* Designed a star schema data model for performance
* Created calculated measures for profit and margin analysis
* Validated revenue and profit consistency across dimensions

### 🎯 KPIs Defined (WHY THESE KPIs)

* Total Revenue → Overall business scale
* Total Profit → Actual value creation
* Profit Margin → Pricing and cost effectiveness
* YoY Growth → Strategic performance trend

### 📈 Dashboard Design

* Executive summary page inspired by consulting dashboards
* Profitability analysis by region and product
* Trend analysis to identify growth and decline patterns

### 🔍 Key Insights
