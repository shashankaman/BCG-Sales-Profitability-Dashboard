## BCG Sales & Profitability Dashboard

### 📌 About This Project

This project is inspired by consulting-style executive dashboards, focusing on understanding not just sales growth but true profitability drivers across regions and products. The objective was to provide leadership with a high-level strategic view of business performance.

The dashboard emphasizes clean data modeling, profit and margin analysis, and well-structured KPIs to uncover where value is actually being created. Insights are presented in a concise, executive-friendly format aligned with real consulting deliverables.

This project reflects my ability to think beyond raw numbers and deliver strategy-oriented analytics suitable for senior management decision-making.
